#Introduction#
Today, Susan and I looked at a number of user friendly systems for taking notes. We choose to dowload Subline Text 3. This is a program that is for taking and notes, and making changes between projects with ease. One that is easily read or converted by any machine. We both found this to be a useful tool for doing our research or possible writing up or notes from a conference. However, we did think Trailbazer would be a wonderfully useful tool; however, you cannot us it on a Windows system. 

#Software & Setup
We used Sublime Text 3038, and followed the directions, which made it fairly easy to set up and use immediately. According to the homepage, this is a sophisticated text editor for code, makeup, and prose. I have not had the time to try out the program but it does look interesting. 

#Notebook
Using Sublime Text 3 one can use it to take notes in class and in our own research. It claims to make finding things easier and change a large amount at once or one at a time. It works across many platforms, such as, Windows, OS X, and Linux. It is customizable and works between projects with very little effort. The only downfall I can see is that to have the deluxe version you have to purchase the license. 

#Conclusion
The website has great information and a blog that helps one understand it manys uses. However, to use it to it's full effectiveness, I would have to know code, which at the moment is limited.
